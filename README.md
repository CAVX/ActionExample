# CAVX.Bot.Framework

I use this framework for a variety of private Discord bots I write, and I published it in case it might be a good starting point for anyone writing a Discord bot in .NET using Discord.NET Labs. It's rough around the edges, but has some good functionality.

Notably, I don't have documentation for leveraging it, but I'm happy to assist where necessary on that front.
